# gatech_files
This is the repository that contains all the work done by me for the assignment for Georgia Tech research project.
For the assignment, I have done the Section 1.1 of the assignment and the backend code for downloading the 10-K filings.

For section 1.1 code, I have used the sec-edgar-downloader to download the 10-K filings of the Companies with the tokens - 'MSFT', 'V', 'JPM'. A function is defined in the code which basically downloads the specific company's 10-K filings.
